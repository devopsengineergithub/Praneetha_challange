To architect a scalable and secure static web application in AWS, we can follow the following steps:

Create an AWS account and set up a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with at least two public and private subnets in different availability zones. The VPC will provide a private network for our web application.

Choose a configuration management tool such as Ansible or Terraform to automate the deployment and management of our web server.

Create a security group that allows only the necessary ports to be publicly exposed (e.g., 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS traffic) and restricts access to the web server only from the VPC.

Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with a pre-installed web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

Create an SSL/TLS certificate and configure the web server to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS. We can use a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

Configure the DNS to point to the public IP address of the web server. We can use Route53 or any other DNS provider.

To ensure the scalability of our web application, we can use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) that distributes incoming traffic to multiple instances of the web server. We can also set up auto-scaling policies to automatically launch new instances when the traffic increases.

We can create automated tests to validate the correctness of the server configuration using tools such as Selenium or Apache JMeter. These tests can be integrated into our deployment pipeline to ensure that any changes to the web application do not break the existing functionality.

All of the above configurations can be expressed in code using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation. This will allow us to easily reproduce the same configuration in multiple environments and reduce the chances of human errors.

With these steps, we can create a scalable and secure static web application in AWS.
